GSE192714	14	Enhancer decommissioning by MLL4 ablation elicits dsRNA-interferon signaling and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis to potentiate anti-tumor immunity	Transcriptional enhancers instruct spatiotemporal gene expression and their dysfunction has long been known as one of the primary mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis and confer malignant tumor cell behaviors. However, it is largely unknown about whether tumor cell enhancer regulation plays a role in tumor immune evasion and anti-tumor immune response. Here, we demonstrate that tumor cell deletion of Mll3 and Mll4, two members of COMPASS family for enhancer H3K4 mono-methylation, increases tumor cell immunogenicity and promotes anti-tumor immune response.
GSE198540	8	Inter-organellar and systemic survival responses to impaired mitochondrial matrix protein import in skeletal muscle	Mitochondrial functions are largely performed by proteins imported from cytosol. Impaired protein import in mitochondria affects the maintenance of intra-mitochondrial anabolic and energy metabolic pathways. It leads to cytosolic accumulation of mistargeted proteins and activation of cellular stress responses. To explore the communication between these mechanism in mammalian system, we targeted the co-chaperone of mitochondrial Hsp70, a GrpE Like protein 1 (Grpel1), in mice.
GSE207957	12	Effect of global Caspase-1 (Casp1) knockout (KO) on kidney gene expression in an orthologous mouse model of polycystic kidney disease (PKD)	We examined the effects of global Caspase-1 KO on kidney gene expression in an orthologous mouse model of PKD, which carries a homozygous knockin missense mutation, Pkd1RC/RC , that matches a human disease allele, PKD1 p.R3277C ("RC").

We demonstrate that epigenetic silencing of otubain 2 (OTUB2), a previously recognized oncogene, drives SSCs initiation and drug resistance.
GSE137505	6	Genome-wide expression analysis in murine liver after Nbs1 induced knockout	NBS1 (Nbn in Mus musculus) is a critical component of the MRN (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1) complex, which regulates ATM- and ATR-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. NBS1 mutations cause the human genomic instability syndrome Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS), in which microcephaly and intellectual disability are marked neuronal deficits. NBS1 is essential for life, because of its function in the DDR to ensure proliferation and preventing the cell death of replicating cells.
GSE212739	2	Effect of depletion of Rcrin on gene expression in mouse liver tissues	To investigate the function of Rcrin in liver, we established Rcrin flox mice and crossed with Alb-cre mice, then we generated Rcrin conditional knockout mice. Then we got liver tissues from Rcrin conditional knockout mice and Rcrin flox mice. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of Rcrin conditional knockout mice (Rcrin knockout) and Rcrin flox mice (WT) at age of 8 weeks old.
GSE179398	12	Transcriptomic data from the liver of Ahr knockout mice	Alcoholic liver disease, which varies in severity from mild steatosis to cirrhosis and hepatitis, is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases worldwide. Excessive alcohol consumption remains the leading cause of ALD and alcohol-related complications and deaths. However, no medications have been developed to treat this disease and its pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, to understand alcohol-induced AhR activation in more detail, transcriptomic data was conducted using livers from mice subjected to either control or Lieber-DeCarli alcohol diets.

GSE212294	32	Transcriptional profilling of liver from C57BL/6 wildtype and PPARα-knockout mice treated with PFOA and GenX after 20 weeks of high-fat diet	Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are man-made chemicals with suspected endocrine-disrupting properties. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been linked to disturbed metabolism via the liver, although the exact mechanism is not clear. Moreover, information on the metabolic effects of the new PFAS alternative GenX is limited. We tested whether low-dose exposure to PFOA and GenX induces metabolic disturbances, including NAFLD, dyslipidemia, and glucose tolerance in mice and studied the involvement of PPARα.
GSE182137	4	10X single-cell RNA-sequencing profiling of hepatic non-parenchymal cells from LPS or PBS-administrated Hlj1 knockout and littermate wild-type mice.	Hlj1 knockout mice survive better than wild-type mice when injected with a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As the liver is the major source for production of inflammatory cytokines and is also responsible for bacterial and toxin clearance when hosts are exposed to pathogens, we asked whether Hlj1 participated in immune modulation in the liver.  We isolated and sequenced each hepatic non-parenchymal cells from these mice, and identified Hlj1 as the key regulator to enhance IFN-g-related signaling in NK cells.
GSE189351	8	Global tibialis anterior skeletal muscle transcript data from male Carm1 skm-/- (HSAcre Tg/0 x Floxed Carm1) and Carm1 skm+/+ mice (HSAcre 0/0 x Floxed Carm1) on a chow diet.	Transcript data from tibialis anterior muscle from male muscle-specific Coactivator-Associated Arginine Methyltransferase 1 (Carm1 ) knockout mice (Carm1 skm-/- ) and wild-type mice (Carm1 skm+/+) generated by using the Cre-loxP system (on a C57BL6J/129 background) with HSA-Cre mice (from Jackson laboratories). We used RNA-Seq to detail the effects of muscle-specific loss of Carm1  on the global program of gene expression in tibialis anterior muscle.
GSE171156	4	mRNA transcriptome analysis of Ddx6 knockout embryos	DDX6 is an RNA helicase and involved in various post-transcriptional regulatory processes. Although DDX6 is an evolutionarily well conserved central player in post-transcriptional gene regulation, its function in embryonic development remains obscure. To study this, we examined Ddx6 knockout mouse embryos and pluripotent cell lines. E8.5 Ddx6 mutants exhibited gastrulation defects. To transcriptomically identify the existing cell population in E8.5 mutant embryos and further find the possible causes of this defect, we performed RNA-seq analysis with E8.5 embryo cDNA libraries.
GSE179138	24	Analysis of gonadal fat from male control and adipocyte-specific LAMA4 knockout mice	To determine the transcriptomic effects of LAMA4 loss on adipose tissue structure and gene expression in two dietary paradigms, we assessed gonadal white adipose tissue of male control and adipocyte-specific LAMA4 knockout mice using a Quant-Seq strategy.

To explore the underlying mechanism for the regulatory role of SIRT3 in pancreatic islets under standard and high fat diet feeding, we conducted RNA sequencing on the isolated islets from standard diet and high fat diet-fed wild type and pancreatic beta cell selective Sirt3 knockout mice (four groups in total). Three biological replicates were performed for each group.
GSE199926	4	Single-cell analysis of bone marrow B220+ cells from 56R and  LAPTM5 knockout (LAPTM5KO) 56R mice	We used single-cell transcriptomics and BCR sequencing to analyze B cell development in 56R and LAPTM5KO 56R mice. We found increased proportions of immature B and mature B cells in LAPTM5KO 56R mice compared to 56R mice. QuSAGE analysis revealed that immature B cells from LAPTM5KO 56R mice were enriched in PI3K-Akt, mTOR, Ras and MAPK signaling pathways that contribute to cell survival. Moreover, mature B cells from LAPTM5KO 56R mice were enriched for activated autoimmune disease and transplant rejection pathways compared with those from 56R mice, suggesting that LAPTM5KO 56R mice might be more susceptible to autoimmunity.
GSE196318	18	High throughput sequencing for circRNAs and mRNAs in XPO4 knockout NIH/3T3 cell [RNA-seq]	Numerous RNAs are exported from the nucleus, abnormalities of which lead to cellular complications and diseases. We report the identification of Exportin 4 (XPO4) as a conserved circular RNA (circRNA) exportin. Cellular insufficiency of XPO4 causes nuclear circRNA accumulation, circRNA:DNA (ciR-loop) formation, linear RNA:DNA (liR-loop) buildup, and DNA damage. These results provide insights into the mechanism and biomedical links of circRNA nuclear export.

GSE188156	24	The major urinary protein gene cluster knockout mouse as a novel model for translational metabolism research [RNAseq]	Scientific evidence suggests that not only murine scent communication is regulated by major urinary proteins, but that their expression may also vary in response to metabolism via a yet unknown mechanism. Major urinary proteins are expressed mainly in the liver, showing a sexually dimorphic pattern with substantially higher expression in males. Here, we investigate the metabolic implications of a major urinary protein knockout in twelve-week-old male and female C57BL/6N mice during ad libitum feeding.

Studying the molecular basis for the skeletal muscle mitochondrial stress response could potentially be targeted to counteract metabolic disorders such as obesity. We uncovered a crucial role for the mitochondrial protease LONP1 in controlling the muscle mitochondrial proteostasis stress response that governs systemic metabolic homeostasis. Skeletal muscle-specific ablation of LONP1 led to broad genomic reprogramming of muscle and protected the mice from HFD-induced obesity.
GSE208224	2	Single-cell RNA-seq profiling of small intestinal epithelium from whole body miR-375 knockout mice (baseline)	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional gene regulators in organ development. To explore candidate roles for miRNAs in prenatal SI lineage specification in humans, we used a multi-omic analysis strategy in a directed differentiation model that programs human pluripotent stem cells toward the SI lineage. We leveraged small RNA-seq to define the changing miRNA landscape, and integrated chromatin run-on sequencing (ChRO-seq) and RNA-seq to define genes subject to significant post-transcriptional regulation across the different stages of differentiation.

In this study, we investigated roles of a Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1), an essential microglial pH regulatory protein, in microglial proinflammatory activation and OL survival and differentiation in a murine TBI model induced by controlled cortical impact.
GSE198769	15	Bronchoalveolar lavage alveolar macrophage subset transcriptomes in WT and NOX2-knockout mice	The leukocyte NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) plays a key role in pathogen killing and immunoregulation. Genetic defects in NOX2 result in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), associated with microbial infections and inflammatory disorders, often involving the lung. Alveolar macrophages (AM) are the predominant immune cell in the airways at steady state, and limiting their activation is important given constant exposure to inhaled materials, yet the importance of NOX2 in this process is not well-understood.
GSE197291	32	Time-dependent alteration of gene expression after induced knockout of Trex1 in bone marrow derived macrophages.	Defects in three prime repair exonuclease (TREX1) cause the type I interferonopathy Aicardi Goutières syndrome. In absence of TREX1 some unknown DNA is accumulating in the cytosol which triggers cGAS/STING activation and type I interferon production. This analysis was designed to understand the kinetics of accumulation of the pathogenic cGAS ligand and the resulting altered gene expression upon induced loss of TREX1.

GSE164558	6	Transcriptome profiling of wild-type (WT) and USP8 knockout (KO) CT26 cell lines	USP8 is one of DUBs and is frequently overexpressed or gain-of-function mutated in multiple types of human cancer. Importantly, USP8 has been identified as an immunomodulatory DUB as T cell-specific Usp8 deficiency disrupts regulatory T cell functions, leading to recruiting abundant CD8+ T cells in colons and resulting in the inflammatory bowel disease in mice. However, whether targeting USP8 can enhance anti-tumor immunity has not been reported.
GSE180204	16	LRH1 can help reprogram sexual cell fate and is required for Sertoli cell development and spermatogonial stem cell maintenance in the mouse testis	The mammalian nuclear hormone receptors LRH1 and SF1 are close paralogs that can bind the same DNA site and play crucial roles in gonadal development and function. Lrh1 has been shown to be essential for follicle development in the ovary and also has been proposed to regulate steroidogenesis in the testis, but genetic analysis of its role in the male gonad has not been reported. Here we use conditional genetics to examine Lrh1 requirements in gonadal cell fate reprogramming and in normal development of the three major cell lineages of the mouse testis.

GSE185256	3	Single cell RNAseq was conducted on mice with TIPE protein knockout to identify the effect of TIPE proteins on immune response [Lung]	Mucosal surfaces are continuously exposed to, and challenged by, numerous commensal and pathogenic organisms. To guard against infections, a majority of the thymus-derived T lymphocytes are deployed at the mucosa. Although chemokines are known to be involved in the mucosal lymphocyte deployment, it is not clear whether lymphocytes enter the mucosa through directed migration or enhanced random migration.
GSE184178	4	NFAT5 Controls the Integrity of Skin I	The skin protects the human body against dehydration and harmful challenges. Keratinocytes (KCs) are the most frequent epidermal cells, and it is anticipated that KC-mediated transport of Na+ ions creates a physiological barrier of high osmolality against the external environment. We studied in KCs the role of NFAT5, a transcription factor whose activity is controlled by osmotic stress. Cultured KCs from adult mice secrete more than 300 proteins, and upon NFAT5 ablation, the secretion of several matrix proteinases, including metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and kallikrein-related peptidase 7 (Klk7), was markedly enhanced.

GSE176117	25	RNA-seq profiling of bone marrow-derived alveolar macrophages, foetal-derived alveolar macrophages and foetal-derived Langerhans cells from the lungs of wildtype and Suz12 knockout mice	Macrophages are at the forefront of immune responses and their transcriptional programs are modified by their tissue environment and in response to immunological challenge. Post-translational modifications of histones, such as histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), are tightly associated with epigenetic regulation of gene expression. To explore whether H3K27me3 is involved in either the establishment or function of the mononuclear phagocyte system, we selectively deleted the SUZ12 gene in mice, a core component of PRC2.
GSE176116	5	RNA-seq profiling of foetal-derived Langerhans cells from wildtype and Suz12 knockout mice	Macrophages are at the forefront of immune responses and their transcriptional programs are modified by their tissue environment and in response to immunological challenge. Post-translational modifications of histones, such as histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), are tightly associated with epigenetic regulation of gene expression. To explore whether H3K27me3 is involved in either the establishment or function of the mononuclear phagocyte system, we selectively deleted the SUZ12 gene in one-week old mice, a core component of PRC2.
GSE176115	9	RNA-seq profiling of foetal-derived alveolar macrophages from wildtype and Suz12 knockout mice	Macrophages are at the forefront of immune responses, and their transcriptional programs are modified by their tissue environment and in response to immunological challenge.

GSE188871	36	RNA-seq and ATAC-seq profiling of thymic epithelial cells from wildtype and Kat7 knockout mice	The autoimmune regulator, AIRE, induces the transcription of thousands of peripheral tissue genes (PTGs) in thymic epithelial cells (TECs) to mediate immunological tolerance. The chromatin state required for optimal AIRE function in TECs and how this state is induced remains unclear. Using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, we tested the role of the histone acetyltransferase, KAT7 (also known as HBO1 or MYST2), which is essential for acetylation of histone 3 lysine 14 (H3K14), in TEC differentiation, AIRE-mediated PTG expression and thymic tolerance.
GSE188870	18	RNA-seq profiling of cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells from wildtype and Kat7 knockout mice	Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) govern thymic T lymphocyte differentiation and selection. They can be divided into cortical and medullary TECs based on their anatomical location, function and molecular features. Cortical TECs (cTECs) provide the microenvironment for the commitment of haematopoietic precursors to the T lymphoid lineage and mediate the positive selection of CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes.
GSE188869	12	RNA-seq profiling of epithelial cells from fetal thymic organ cultures from Kat7 knockout and wildtype mice	Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) govern thymic T lymphocyte differentiation and selection. Medullary TECs are distinctive for their "promiscuous" gene expression, transcribing thousands of peripheral tissue genes (PTG) that are otherwise only expressed highly in one or two other organs. Much of this PTG expression by mTECs is controlled by the autoimmune regulator, AIRE. This experiment was part of a larger study in which we examined the impact of Kat7 loss on AIRE-mediated PTG expression.
GSE165274	12	Characterization of novel whole body Poldip2 knockout mice generated by [Precisely "flox"ing Poldip2 gene] and crossing with Cre deleter mice	Poldip2 is a multifunctional protein whose roles are only partially understood. The previous Poldip2 knockout mouse generated by the gene trap model suffers from two limitations: perinatal lethality in homozygotes and constitutive Poldip2 inactivation. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new conditional floxed Poldip2 mouse. Here, we correctly targeted floxed Poldip2 mice to produce a new constitutive knockout line by crossing with a Cre deleter.
GSE174013	4	Single-cell RNAseq analysis of kidneys from Wild Type and RNLS knockout control mice and mice with chronic kidney disease	We compared transcriptome profiles of WT kidneys with that of RNLS KO kidneys.

GSE179163	31	The effects of MuRF1 knockout, sex, and a high fat diet consumption on gastrocnemius muscle transcriptomics.	MuRF1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase known to play a role in skeletal muscle atrophy.  Our objectives in this study were to gain further insight into the roles MuRF1 plays in skeletal muscle and to determine if this is influenced by sex and/or consumption of a high fat diet.  To address these objectives we used RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of gastrocnemius muscle from 30 week old, MuRF1 knockout (-/-) and wild type, male and female mice fed a chow or high fat diet (HFD).
GSE154519	12	Temporal Analyses of Cardiac Chromatin Accessibility, DNA Methylation and Epigenomic Structure Reveal Locus-Specific Regulation [RNA-seq]	Heart failure can be induced or ameliorated by regulation of chromatin modifying enzymes. Because so many chromatin factors regulate gene expression, we used ATAC-seq to report the status of a given locus at any time—the sum total of all epigenetic modifiers—in a mouse model of pressure overload hypertrophy. Early compensation of pressure overload at 3 days was associated with widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation, the majority of which persisted to the decompensated phase (3 weeks), revealing the temporal nature of epigenomic compensation to pathologic stimuli.
GSE167126	2	Single-cell transcriptional analysis of lens placode development in Mab21l1 knockout mice	In mouse early organogenic stages, a Mab21l1-null mutation causes severe defects in invagination of the lens placode toward optic cup due to its severe defects in both cell proliferation and survival, which subsequently results in severe microphthalmia after birth. In human, loss of function variants in MAB21L1 have recently been described in Cerebello-Oculo-Facio-Genital syndrome (COFG syndrome). The close similarity between mouse and human phenotypes including microphthalmia indicates the importance of Mab21l1 function in human lens placode.

Genomic profiling of primary ccRCC tumors reveals a positive correlation between SETD2 mutations and metastasis. However, whether and how SETD2-loss promotes metastasis remains unclear. Here, we detected SETD2 mutations in 24 of 51 (47%) metastatic ccRCC tumors.
GSE172282	72	Dicer promotes genome stability via the bromodomain transcriptional co-activator BRD4	RNA interference is required for post-transcriptional silencing, but also has additional roles in transcriptional silencing of centromeres and genome stability. However, these roles have been difficult to detect in mammals. Strikingly, we found that Dicer-deficient embryonic stem cells have strong proliferation and chromosome segregation defects as well as increased transcription of centromeric satellite repeats, which triggers the interferon response.
GSE175389	11	Deletion of Abi3 gene locus exacerbates neuropathological features of Alzheimer’s disease in a mouse model of Aβ amyloidosis	Recently, large-scale human genetics studies identified a rare coding variant in the ABI3 gene that is associated with an increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, pathways by which ABI3 contributes to the pathogenesis of AD are unknown. To address this critical question, we determined whether loss of ABI3 function affects pathological features of AD in the 5XFAD mouse model. We demonstrate that the deletion of Abi3 locus significantly increases amyloid-b (Ab) accumulation and decreases microglia clustering around the plaques.
GSE179454	12	Tenomodulin prevents trauma-induced heterotopic ossification in tendon	We have reported that loss of Tnmd leads to inferior early tendon repair characterized by fibrovascular scaring and therefore hypothesized that its lack will persistently cause deficient repair during later stages. Tnmd knockout (Tnmd-/-) and wild-type (WT) animals were subjected to complete Achilles tendon surgical transection followed by end-to-end suture.

Purpose: The goals of this study is to compare transcriptome profiles of microglia from different mouse genotypes using RNA-seq analysis. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occur in about 50% of infected individuals. Transgenic mice expressing the soluble HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 in astroglia (HIVgp120tg) display key neuropathological features of NeuroHIV patients (Toggas et al., 1994; Maung et al., 2014; Ojeda-Juarez et al., 2020).
GSE171931	12	Transcriptome analysis of memantine-treated Shank2 wild-type and knock-out mice	Shank2 is an excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein strongly implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Shank2-mutant mice with a homozygous deletion of exons 6 and 7 show decreased NMDA receptor (NMDAR) functions and autistic-like behaviors in juvenile (~postnatal day or P21) and adult (> P56) stages that are rescued by NMDAR activation. These mice, however, show an opposite change increased NMDAR functions—at ~P14, and NMDAR suppression by early and chronic memantine treatment during P7–21 prevents NMDAR hypofunction and autistic-like behaviors at juvenile (~P21) and adult (~P56) stages.

This study was to test the hypothesis that ablation of the Slc6a4 gene would result in morphological changes correlated with defined gene expression changes in the placenta. We found that Slc6a4 KO placentas had a much increased pTGC to spongiotrophoblast area ratio relative to WT placentas.
GSE184760	8	RNA-Sequencing analysis of adipose tissue from obese WT mice and AP2-Cre MCT1 knockout mice	Adipose tissue is an active producer of lactate. In obesity, the increased size of adipocytes is accompanied by an increase in lactate production in adipose tissue, caused by hypoxia in obese adipocytes. How lactate affects metabolism in adipocyte and insulin sensitivity remains unclear. Here we develop a mouse model of MCT1,coding by Slc16a1, specific deletion in adipose tissues, using the AP2 promoter to drive Cre expression.
GSE169245	24	Influence of Dnmt3a knockout on gene expression of preleukemia B cell and CLL cells	Although somatic mutations in the DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are rare, DNMT3A transcript and protein expression is frequently reduced in CLL patients, and previous studies have associated low DNMT3A expression with more aggressive disease and poorer survival.
GSE185109	8	HRD1-mediated METTL14 degradation regulates m6A mRNA modification to suppress ER proteotoxic liver disease	Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen triggers unfolded protein response (UPR) for stress adaptation, the failure of which induces cell apoptosis and tissue/organ damage. The molecular switches underlying how the UPR selects for stress adaptation over apoptosis remain unknown. Here we discovered that accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins selectively induces N6-adenosine-methyltransferase-14 (METTL14) expression.

GSE153190	8	RNA-sequencing of mouse mammary tumor organoids that were modified to generate knockout lines for SOX4	The transcription factor SOX4 is widely expressed during development and is essential to maintain progenitor pools in a variety of organs. In breast cancer SOX4 has been shown to be associated with poor survival and increased tumor size and metastasis formation. This has mostly been attributed to the ability of SOX4 to regulate Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT). However, SOX4 regulates target gene transcription in a plastic manner that is dependent on the cellular and epigenetic context.
GSE175372	10	Effect of Cited2 knockout on gene expression in haematopoietic stem cells	The pleiotropic transcriptional regulator CITED2 is essential for lifelong maintenance of haematopoiesis.

YAP1 KO mice are viable postnatally and survive long-term despite a complete failure of  intrahepatic bile duct development, resembling the liver phenotype of Alagille syndrome. We also observed no functional biliary regeneration over time.
GSE119570	9	Cortical transcriptome analysis of Cyfip2 mutant mice	CYFIP2 is a component of the WAVE regulatory complex which regulates actin polymerization and branching in diverse cellular compartments. Recent molecular genetic studies identified mutations of CYFIP2 in patients with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy and microcephaly, suggesting that CYFIP2 may have some roles in embryonic brain development. To understand its functions in vivo at the molecular level, we performed RNA-seq analysis in embryonic Cyfip2 mutant mice.
GSE157714	9	TDP-43 represses a cryptic exon in Schwann cells to ensure rapid saltatory conduction	A pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia is the aggregation of TDP-43. While extensive exploration into the function of TDP-43 has focused entirely in the central nervous system (CNS), the implications in physiology and pathology of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) have long been overlooked. Herein, we demonstrate that deletion of TDP-43 in Schwann cells results in a 50% reduction in peripheral nerve conduction velocity, without any obvious alterations to peripheral compact myelin.
GSE118826	6	RNA seq data of B cells from naïve, OPN knockout (Spp1-/-), ONKOSCID (SCID Spp1-/-) BALB/c mice	Marginal zone (IgM[hi] CD23[lo]MZ) and Follicular B (IgM[lo] CD23[hi]FB) cells in SCID Spp1-/- mice have different profile from naïve and Spp1-/- B cells. In addition, OPN mutation on the SCID background induced upregulation of genes involved in DNA replication and class switching of B cells
GSE181885	8	Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis of Uterine Gene Expression in Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (Ezh2) Conditional Knockout Mice	Histone proteins undergo various modifications that alter chromatin structure, including addition of methyl groups. Enhancer of homolog 2 (EZH2), is a histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine residue 27, and thereby, suppresses gene expression. EZH2 plays integral role in the uterus and other reproductive organs. We have previously shown that conditional deletion of uterine EZH2 results in increased proliferation of luminal and glandular epithelial cells, and RNAseq analyses reveal several uterine transcriptomic changes in Ezh2 conditional (c) knockout (KO) mice that can affect estrogen signaling pathways.

GSE182091	16	CRISPR-Cas9 generated SARM1 knockout and epitope tagged mice reveal no role in transcription, despite confirmation of protein expression in macrophages	The aim of this study was initially to determine the mechanism by which SARM1 regulates Ccl5 expression in murine macrophages. RNA sequencing revealed that the commonly used Sarm1tm1Aidi mouse, generated by targeted gene disruption, harbours passenger genes on chromosome 11 which confound interpretation of differential gene expression. Next-generation SARM1-deficient and epitope-tagged mice generated by CRISPR/Cas9 reveal no broad role for SARM1 in transcription in macrophages or brainstem, despite SARM1 protein expression there.

GSE154002	10	Comparative analysis of brain transcriptomes altered during JEV infection in wild type and IRF8 knockout C57Bl/6 mice	Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a causative agent of encephalitis, mostly prevalent in Asia and South-Asian countries. Neuroinflammation is the hallmark of encephalitis, mediated in parts through the activation of brain-resident microglial cell, thus playing a critical role in determining pathogenesis. Deregulated activity of microglia can be lethal for the brain tissue. Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (Irf8) mediates differentiation and transformation of microglia to reactive phenotypes and also regulates antiviral response through cross-talk with interferon pathway.
GSE168200	3	Cellular crosstalk regulates the aqueous humor outflow pathway and provides new targets for glaucoma therapies	Angiopoietin-1 signaling is essential for development of Schlemm's canal, a large lymphatic-like endothelial vessel in the iridocorneal angle. Single cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool allowing for examination of the specific transcriptome of each cell type within a tissue. Here, we used single cell RNA sequencing to examin the structures of the mouse iridocorneal angle, using loss of Schlemm's canal in neural-crest specific Angpt1 knockout mice to aid in identification of Schlemm's canal endothelial cells.

GSE148577	12	An epithelial Nfkb2 pathway exacerbates intestinal inflammation by supplementing latent RelA complexes to the canonical NF-kB module	The canonical NF-kB module induces nuclear translocation of RelA heterodimers from the latent cytoplasmic complexes. RelA directs inflammatory immune responses against microbial entities. However, aberrant RelA activity also triggers destructive inflammation, including those associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). What provokes this pathological RelA activity remains unclear. As such, the noncanonical NF-kB pathway activates RelB heterodimers and mediates immune organogenesis.

Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most prevalent histological subtype of RCC in which more than 80% of ccRCC cases are associated with early inactivation of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. We have generated a knockout mouse strain in which mouse allele of VHL (Vhlh) is conditionally deleted in the kidney epithelium (cortical tubules, collecting ducts and ascending Loops of Henle).
GSE165701	24	mTORC1 Activation is not sufficient to suppress hepatic PPAR-a signalling or ketogenesis	we examined if the activation of the anabolic program mediated by the activation of the mTorc1 complex in the fasted state could suppress the robust catabolic programing and enhanced Pparα transcriptional of mice with a liver specific defect in mitochondrial long chain fatty acid oxidation (Cpt2L-/- mice). We found that the activation of mTorc1 in the fasted state was not sufficient to repress Pparα responsive genes or ketogenesis.

In this dataset, mammary glands from wild-type and adipocyte Tsc1 knockout mice were isolated during lactation and analysed by RNAseq.  Deletion of Tsc1 is predicted to activate mTORC1 in both peripheral and mammary adipocytes.  This study demonstrates that deletion of Tsc1 in adipocytes changes mammary gland histology, and function resulting in changes to breastmilk composition.

Stromal vascular cells were isolated from inguinal adipose tissue of Pdgfra-Cre; TERT fl/fl mice (Sample name A_SAT), Pdgfrb-Cre; TERT fl/fl mice (Sample name KO_SAT), and of control TERT WT mice (Sample name PBS_SAT).
GSE157624	28	Next generation sequencing of CD11b+ cells from female and male Wildtype and Cystatin C knockout mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)	Rationale: Towards clarifying the role of the cysteine protease inhibitor, Cystatin C (CysC), whose expression is augmented in the brains of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and C57BL/6J mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE - a model of MS), we discovered that CysC plays a detrimental function in MOG35-55-induced EAE, but only in female animals. Female CysC null mice displayed significantly lower clinical signs of disease compared to wildtype (WT) littermates that was associated with reduced interleukin-6 production and lower expression of key proteins (CD80, CD86, MHC II, LC3A/B) involved in antigen processing, presentation and co-stimulation in antigen presenting cells (APCs), specifically CD11b+ cells.
GSE147415	2	Single-cell RNA-seq of embryonic day 17 (E17) mouse skin epithelial cells with or without Mettl3 knockout	We employed single-cell RNA sequencing to examine effects on steady-state RNA levels induced by METTL3 depletion in mouse skin epithelium during morphogenesis.

GSE151119	12	RNA-seq analysis of HSF1 knockout on LiCl treatment	Heat shock transcription factor 1(HSF1) is an important transcription factor which regulates the expression of a wide array of genes including heat shock proteins and oncogenes. Here, we report that HSF1 as a target of WNT/β-catenin signaling, regulates parts of target genes of WNT/β-catenin signaling. To explore the biological relevance of HSF1 activation to WNT/β-catenin signaling, we profiled gene expression of wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (WT MEF) and HSF1 knock out MEF (HSF1 KO MEF) before and after lithium chloride (LiCl) treatment which was a potent GSK3β inhibitor and increased the expression of β-catenin.
GSE155863	4	Strand-specific RNA-seq analysis after Ssrp1 knockout in embryonic stem cells	Endogenous retrovirus MERVL is specifically expressed in a minority of embryonic stem cells. To determine the restrain mechanism of MERVL, we knocked out Ssrp1 and analyzed the effect on the expression of transposable elements and coding genes.
GSE141788	8	RNA-seq analysis after Ssrp1 knockout or Usp7 depletion in embryonic stem cells	Endogenous retrovirus MERVL is specifically expressed in a minority of embryonic stem cells. To determine the restrain mechanism of MERVL, we knocked out Ssrp1 and analyzed the effect on the expression of transposable elements and coding genes. Ssrp1 further interacts with ubiquitin specific protease Usp7. We knocked down usp7 and analyzed the effect on the expression of MERVL. It turns out the deletion of ssrp1 or usp7 would lead to upregulation of MERVL.

GSE126127	18	Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of the brain in CNS-specific PRMT1 knockout mice.	Arginine methylation is a common post-translation modification that is catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). We generated the central nervous system-specific PRMT1 deficient (PRMT1-CKO) mice by Cre-loxP recombination system. Recently, we have discovered that PRMT1 is essential for development of CNS, and it is especially crucial for oligodendrocyte lineage progression and the subsequent myelination.

Methods: Total RNA from heart apex of postnatal day (P) 7.5 Xinβ KO or WT mice were profiled by bulk-RNA sequencing (50bp SE). Total RNA from heart apex of P7.5 Xinβ KO or WT mice injected with AAV9 carrying cardiac troponin T promoter driven active Yap (S127A) or GFP (control) at P1 were profiled by bulk-RNA sequencing (150bp PE).
GSE152534	6	The cytokine IL-17A limits Th17 pathogenicity via a negative feedback loop driven by autocrine induction of IL-24	Dysregulated Th17 cell responses underlie multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune uveitis and its animal model, EAU. However, clinical trials targeting IL-17A in uveitis were not successful. Here, we found that Th17 cells were regulated by their own signature cytokine, IL-17A. Loss of IL-17A in autopathogenic Th17 cells did not reduce their pathogenicity and instead elevated their expression of the Th17 cell cytokines GM-CSF and IL-17F.

Subsequent continuous EEG monitoring revealed an accelerated and exacerbated epileptogenesis whereby spontaneous seizures began sooner, occurred more frequently and were of longer duration in miR-22-deficient mice. RNA sequencing analysis of the hippocampus of mice during the period of epileptogenesis revealed a widespread suppression of inflammatory signalling in the hippocampus of miR-22-deficient mice.

GSE143598	24	Knockout of reactive astrocyte activating factors slows disease progression in an ALS mouse model	Reactive astrocytes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including a non-cell autonomous effect on motor neuron survival in ALS. We previously defined a mechanism by which microglia release three factors, IL-1α, TNFα, and C1q, to induce neurotoxic astrocytes. Here we report that knocking out these three factors markedly extends survival in the SOD1G93A ALS mouse model, providing evidence for gliosis as a potential ALS therapeutic target.
GSE143206	18	RNA-seq for the tissues of Pcgf6 knockout mice and wild type mice	Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential for maintenance of lineage fidelity by coordinating developmental gene expression programs. Polycomb group protein Pcgf6 has been previously reported to repress lineage-specific genes, especially germ cell-related genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) via the non- canonical Polycomb repressive complex PRC1. 6.

In this experiment, to further dissect roles of the K262 residue acetylation for Pd-l1 nuclear function, we profiled RNA expression of  WT or K262Q mutant mouse Pd-l1 re-expressed in CT26 KO Pd-l1 cells.
GSE148440	35	Molecular and cellular consequences of genetic knockout of Hdac2 and Hdac3 in striatal medium spiny neurons of Huntington's disease knock-in mice	Somatic expansion of the Huntington’s disease (HD) CAG repeat drives the rate of a pathogenic process resulting in neuronal cell death. Although mechanisms of neuronal toxicity are not well delineated, transcriptional dysregulation is a likely contributor. Chromatin modifiers are implicated in both mechanisms of CAG instability and transcriptional dysregulation. Here, we tested whether histone deacetylase genes Hdac2 and Hdac3 modify molecular and cellular phenotypes in HttQ111 knock-in mice using conditional knockouts in striatal medium-spiny striatal neurons (MSNs) exhibiting extensive CAG expansion and exquisite disease vulnerability.

GSE131425	20	The effects of Arginase 2 (Arg2) knockout on chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension	Increased arginase 2 protein expression is associated with endothelial dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, likely by impairing NO production secondary to substrate availability. Hypoxia induces arginase 2 protein expression contributing to pulmonary vascular cell proliferation. Non-specific arginase inhibitors have been shown to prevent experimental pulmonary hypertension in animal models. RNA was isolated from whole lung tissue from adult (12-14 weeks) arginase 2 wild type and KO mice exposed to 21% O2 or 10% O2 for 28 days.

Several inflammatory-related effects of stress are associated with increased interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling within the central nervous system and are mediated by IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) on several distinct cell types. Neuronal IL-1R1 is prominently expressed on the neurons of the dentate gyrus, but its role in mediating behavioral responses to stress is unknown.
GSE149168	6	RNA-Seq of wild type and miR-574 knockout mouse hearts at baseline	Purpose: The target mRNAs of miR-574 in mouse heart are unknown. The goal of this study is to use next generation sequencing (NGS) RNA-seq followed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) methods to identify the downstream target genes that are directly regulated by miR-574 in murine hearts at the mRNA level.

GSE113158	8	Elucidating the role of glycogen debranching enzyme AGL in bladder carcinogenesis by generation and characterization of knockout mice	Amylo-alpha-1-6-glucosidase-4-alpha-glucanotransferase (AGL) is an enzyme primarily responsible for glycogen debranching. Inactivating germline mutations lead to glycogen storage disease III (GSDIII). AGL was found to be a tumor suppressor in xenograft models of bladder cancer (BC) and low levels of expression in BC were associated with poor patient prognosis. However, the impact of AGL levels in normal tissues on susceptibility to carcinogenesis is unknown.
GSE147288	24	RNA-sequencing from mouse embryonic spinal cord in the presence of FUS knockout or FUS NLS mutation delta14	Mutations in the RNA-binding protein FUS cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of motor neurons induces progressive weakness and death from respiratory failure, typically only 3-5 years after onset. FUS has been established to have a role in numerous aspects of RNA processing, including splicing. However, the impact of ALS-causative mutations on splicing has not been fully characterised, as most disease models have been based on FUS overexpression, which in itself alters its RNA processing functions.
GSE147001	4	Cytosolic dsRNA-induced gene expression in mouse RAW24.7 macrophages and FIP200 knockout RAW cells	Our preliminary data showed that FIP200 is essential for dsRNA-induced interferon production.

GSE146672	4	Single cell RNA sequencing of P7 cortex from Top1 knockout mice	Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) relieves torsional stress in DNA during transcription and facilitates the expression of long (>100 kb) genes, many of which are important for neuronal functions. To evaluate how loss of Top1 affected neurons in vivo, we conditionally deleted (cKO) Top1 in postmitotic excitatory neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus. We found that Top1 cKO neurons developed properly but then showed biased transcriptional downregulation of long genes, signs of DNA damage, neuroinflammation, increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) activity, single-cell somatic mutations, and ultimately degenerated.
GSE117781	12	Cellular origin, tumour progression and pathogenic mechanisms of cutaneous neurofibromas revealed by mice with Nf1 knockout in boundary cap cells	Patients carrying an inactive NF1 allele develop tumours of Schwann cell origin called neurofibromas (NFs). Genetically engineered mouse models have significantly enriched our understanding of plexiform forms of NFs (pNFs). However, this has not been the case for cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), observed in all NF1 patients, as no previous model recapitulates their development. Here, we show that conditional Nf1 inactivation in Prss56-positive boundary cap cells leads to bona fide pNFs and cNFs.

GSE136284	4	RNAseq of C57BL/6J and C57BL6/J Sarm1-deficient mice to determine if genes surrounding the knockout locus are B6 or 129 sequence	The Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor protein SARM1 is expressed primarily in the brain, where it mediates axonal degeneration. Additional roles for SARM1 in a number of other processes including TLR-signaling, viral infection, chemokine expression, and XAF1 expression have also been described. Here we report defects in the induction of Ccl3, Ccl4, and Ccl5 in Sarm1-/- macrophages, for which we were unable to find mechanistic support.
GSE124209	11	Autophagic turnover of NBR1 restricts metastatic colonization during mammary tumor progression	Autophagy is implicated in promoting the metastatic potential of tumor cells. Utilizing a mouse model of mammary cancer to temporally delete essential autophagy regulators, ATG12 or ATG5, in tumor cells during distinct stages of carcinoma progression, we determine a stage-specific role for autophagy in suppressing metastatic colonization. In stark contrast to the tumor-promoting role of autophagy in primary mammary tumors, autophagy restricts colonization of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and prevents the acquisition of basal epithelial characteristics, effects that are dependent on turnover of the autophagy-specific substrate, Neighbor to BRCA1 (NBR1).
GSE126936	16	MicroRNA-202 is a gatekeeper of meiosis initiation and regulates recombination in male germ line	We preformed RNA sequencing to identify differentiatially expressed mRNAs after miR-202 knockout in isolated spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and cultured spermatogonial stem cells from male mice.

GSE133050	17	The Circadian Protein Nocturnin Regulates Metabolic Adaptation in Brown Adipose Tissue	Fine-tuning of transcriptional responses can be critical for long-term outcomes in response to an environmental challenge. The circadian protein Nocturnin belongs to a family of proteins that include exonucleases, endonucleases and phosphatases and is most closely related to the CCR4 family of deadenylases that regulate the cellular transcriptome via control of polyA tail length of RNA transcripts. In this study, we investigate the role of Nocturnin in regulating the transcriptional response and downstream metabolic adaptations during cold exposure in brown adipose tissue. We find that Nocturnin exhibits dual localization within the cytosol and mitochondria, and loss of Nocturnin causes changes in expression of networks of mRNAs involved in mitochondrial function. Furthermore, Nocturnin-/- animals display significantly elevated levels of TCA cycle intermediates indicating that they have distinct metabolic adaptations during a prolonged cold exposure. We conclude that cold-induced stimulation of Nocturnin levels can regulate long-term metabolic adaptations to environmental challenges.
GSE126259	12	TFEB-driven lysosomal biogenesis is pivotal for PGC1a-dependent renal stress resistance	Because injured mitochondria can accelerate cell death through the elaboration of oxidative free radicals and other mediators, it is somewhat paradoxical that proliferator gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1a), a stimulator of increased mitochondrial abundance, protects stressed renal cells instead of potentiating injury. Here we report that PGC1a’s induction of lysosomes via transcription factor EB (TFEB) may be pivotal for kidney protection.

The key transcription factors for NKT1, NKT2 and NKT17 development in the thymus have been identified as T-bet, Gata3 and Rorγt, respectively. In contrast, these iNKT cell subsets can also undergo further differentiation in the periphery. Eomesodermin (Eomes) is a T-box transcription factor with high homology to T-bet and is expressed by activated CD8+ T cells as well as in resting and activated NK cells.

GSE130147	6	Transcriptome comparison of white adipose tissue between control and adipose specific HuR knockout mice	Human antigen R (HuR) is a member of the Hu family of RNA-binding proteins and is involved in many physiological processes. To investigate the role of adipose HuR, we generate adipose-specific HuR knockout (HuRAKO) mice. As compared with control mice, HuRAKO mice show obesity when induced with a high-fat diet, along with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypercholesterolemia and increased inflammation in adipose tissue.

GSE121478	4	Single-cell RNA-sequencing of murine melanoma infiltrating immune cells in wild-type and miR-155 T cell conditional knockout mice	miR-155 has recently emerged as an important promoter of antitumor immunity through its functions in T lymphocytes. However, the impact of T cell expressed miR-155 on immune cell  dynamics in solid tumors remains unclear. In the present study, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to define the CD45+ immune cell populations within B16F10 murine melanoma tumors growing in either wild-type (WT) or miR-155 T cell conditional knockout (TCKO) mice at different timepoints.
GSE129137	8	RNA-seq using RNA from KDM4 WT and Knockout haematopoietic stem cells	The KDM4/JMJD2 are H3K9- and H3K36- specific demethylases, which are considered promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring MLL-translocations. Here, we investigate the long-term effects of depleting KDM4 activity on normal hematopoiesis to probe potential side effects of continuous inhibition of these enzymes. Utilizing conditional Kdm4a/Kdm4b/Kdm4c triple-knockout mice we show that KDM4 activity is required for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance in vivo.
GSE127275	8	Regulation of gene expression in undifferentiated spermatogonia by DDX5	The maintenance of spermatogenesis in adult males is dependent on a population of mitotic germ cells with self-renewal potential known as undifferentiated spermatogonia. Regulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia function is dependent on transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. We have identified an essential role for the RNA helicase DDX5 in undifferentiated spermatogonia through generation of a UBC-CreERT2;Ddx5flox/flox mouse model that allows tamoxifen-dependent Ddx5 ablation.
GSE126687	61	Transcriptom analysis of ZFP708 loss and overexpression in preimplantation embryos and embryonic stem cells	This work describes the function and targets of a maternal KRAB-Zinc finger protein, ZFP708, which specifically mediates maintenance of DNA-methylation at a subset of LTR retrotransposons during embryonic epigenetic reprogramming.
GSE120421	2	Single cell RNA-seq of Epidermal cells from newborn (P1) wildtype and BAP1 knockout mice	BAP1 deletion in primary mouse epidermal cell culture leads to increased melanocytes population. However, it is unclear whether BAP1 exhibits its function in melanocytes or in the progenitor cells for melanocytes, since the epidermal culture contains a mixed cell types. We aim to carry out a single cell RNAseq profiling with this system, and dissect BAP1's roles in different cell types.
GSE118617	12	RNA-seq profiling of basal and luminal mammary cells from Foxp1-deficient and control mice	Long-lived quiescent mammary stem cells (MaSCs) are presumed to coordinate the dramatic expansion of ductal epithelium that occurs through the different phases of postnatal development, but little is known about the molecular regulators that underpin the activation of MaSCs. Here we show that ablation of the transcription factor Foxp1 in the mammary gland profoundly impairs ductal morphogenesis, resulting in a rudimentary tree throughout adult life.
GSE107933	6	Transcriptome analysis of TNFR1-knockout mouse colon	We have compared mRNA expression in full-thickness mouse colon between wildtype mice and mice with a genetic deletion in tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1, encoded by the Tnfrsf1a gene). This experiment was motivated by our observation that Il10-/- Tnfr1-/- double-knockout mice develop very-early-onset colitis at the time of weaning, significantly earlier than disease onset in Il10-/- single-knockout mice.
GSE126217	9	RNAseq analysis of glomerular transcriptome of wild-type vs. Podocyte Cosmc knockout	Cosmc is an obligate chaperone for C1GalT1 T transferase necessary for generating mature mucin-type O-glycans.  Animals lacking Cosmc in glomerular podocytes develop proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal failure.  This study was designed to examine transcriptome differences in 1 month male animals with and without podocyte Cosmc, a time point when proteinuria is established but glomerular architecture is still relatively intact.
GSE123880	14	Differential gene expression in strital and cerebellar tissues from wildtype C57Bl/6 and Thap1 conditional knockout mice	RNA-seq study comparing gene expression in wildtype and nervous system specific Thap1  knock out mice at 6 months of age in striatal and cerebellar tissues.

GSE107872	4	FTO controls reversible m6Am RNA methylation during snRNA biogenesis	Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are core spliceosome components and mediate pre-mRNA splicing. Here we show that snRNAs contain a regulated and reversible nucleotide modification causing them to exist as two different methyl isoforms, m 1 and m 2 , reflecting the methylation state of the adenosine adjacent to the snRNA cap. We find that snRNA biogenesis involves the formation of an initial m 1 isoform with a single-methylated adenosine (2′-O-methyladenosine, Am), which is then converted to a dimethylated m 2 isoform (N 6 ,2′-O-dimethyladenosine, m 6 Am).
GSE96598	9	Expression pattern in dSG knockout mutant mice and effect of treatment with ifetroban	We sequenced RNA from left ventricle of dSG knockout and wild type mice treated with vehicle or ifetroban
GSE123726	2	The Forkhead Box F1 Transcription Factor Inhibits Collagen Deposition and Accumulation of Myofibroblasts During Liver Fibrosis	Hepatic fibrosis is the common end stage to a variety of chronic liver injuries and is characterized by an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), which disrupts the liver architecture and impairs liver function. The fibrous lesions are produced by myofibroblasts, which differentiate from hepatic stellate cells (HSC). The myofibroblasts transcriptional networks remain poorly characterized.
GSE106339	8	Whole ovaries RNA sequencing; WT and ghrelin o-acyltransferase (GOAT) knockout mice	Ghrelin, an orexigenic gut-derived peptide, is gaining increasing attention due to its multifaceted role in a number of physiological functions, including metabolism, cardiovascular health, stress and reproduction. Ghrelin exists in circulation primarily as des-acylated and acylated ghrelin. Des-acyl ghrelin, until recently considered to be an inactive form ghrelin, is now known to have independent physiological functionality.

GSE113106	18	RNA sequencing of control and dnm2-knockout mouse sciatic nerves	In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome profiles of mouse sciatic nerves after developmental (P1 and P5) or  inducible (4 weeks post Tamoxifen) deletion of Dnm2 conditionally in Schwann cells (using a P0Cre-driven or a P0CreERT2-driven recombination of floxed alleles, respectively) as compared to controls (floxed Dnm2 homozygous, Cre-negative).
GSE101511	6	HnRNPGT knockout disrupts pre-mRNA splicing and arrests sperm development prior to meiotic metaphase	Human male infertility has long been associated with genetic defects that affect nuclear RNA binding proteins, yet what RNA targets these proteins control or why their absence causes infertility remain poorly defined. Here we find that genetic knockout of the mouse nuclear RNA binding protein gene Hnrnpgt causes azoospermia. Knockout male germ cells arrest during the highly transcriptionally active stage of meiotic prophase with altered meiotic nuclear RNA processing patterns.
GSE115190	6	RNA-seq analysis of whole liver derived from endothelial specific TAK1 conditional knockout mice.	In this study we show that TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), is crucial for ensuring EC survival on TNFα stimulation. EC-specific TAK1-knockout in adult mice resulted in rapid death of the animal due to destruction of intestinal and liver blood vessels. TNFα from myeloid cells responding to intestinal microbiota was responsible for EC death in the intestine and liver. Our results illuminate mechanisms ensuring survival of intestinal and liver EC under physiological conditions
GSE124729	18	Transcriptomes of E16 neocortical tissue knockout from Nfia, Nfib and Nfix knockout mice	Here, we generated transcriptomes of microdissected neocortex of Nfix knockout and wildtype littermate embryos at embryonic day 16.

GSE114608	6	Genome-wide maps of gene expression in alkaline sphingomyelinase knockout mice	Intestinal alkaline sphingomyelinase (alk-SMase) generates ceramide and inactivates platelet-activating factor and associated with digestion and inhibition of cancer. There is few study to analyze the correlated function and characterize the genes related to alk-SMase comprehensively. In this work, deep RNA sequencing was performed to investigate the function of alk-SMase. Our RNA-seq data found 239 differentially expressed mRNAs between the wild type (WT) mice and alk-SMase (gene NPP7) knockout (KO) mice, in which 73 were significantly up-regulated and 166 were down-regulated, including protein coding genes, non-coding RNAs.
