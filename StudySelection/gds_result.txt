1. Enhancer decommissioning by MLL4 ablation elicits dsRNA-interferon signaling and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis to potentiate anti-tumor immunity
(Submitter supplied) Transcriptional enhancers instruct spatiotemporal gene expression and their dysfunction has long been known as one of the primary mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis and confer malignant tumor cell behaviors. However, it is largely unknown about whether tumor cell enhancer regulation plays a role in tumor immune evasion and anti-tumor immune response. Here, we demonstrate that tumor cell deletion of Mll3 and Mll4, two members of COMPASS family for enhancer H3K4 mono-methylation, increases tumor cell immunogenicity and promotes anti-tumor immune response. more...

3. Inter-organellar and systemic survival responses to impaired mitochondrial matrix protein import in skeletal muscle
(Submitter supplied) Mitochondrial functions are largely performed by proteins imported from cytosol. Impaired protein import in mitochondria affects the maintenance of intra-mitochondrial anabolic and energy metabolic pathways. It leads to cytosolic accumulation of mistargeted proteins and activation of cellular stress responses. To explore the communication between these mechanism in mammalian system, we targeted the co-chaperone of mitochondrial Hsp70, a GrpE Like protein 1 (Grpel1), in mice. more...

40. Functionality of stripe factors on chromatin accessibility (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Mammalian genome encodes approximately 1,700 transcription factors (TFs), 1,300 out of which have sequence specific binding motifs. Transcription in mammalian cells is regulated by the recruitment of TFs to specific cis-regulatory elements. In spite of consistent efforts on the function of individual TF, the question still remains how TFs bind to DNA and form enhancer. Here, we try to solve this problem by investigating the relationship between TF binding pattern and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq). more...

107. Brap regulates liver morphology and hepatocyte turnover via modulation of the Hippo pathway
(Submitter supplied) Regulation of hepatocyte proliferation and liver morphology is of critical importance to tissue and whole-body homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this complex process are incompletely understood. Here we describe a novel role for the ubiquitin ligase BRAP in regulation of hepatocyte morphology and turnover via regulation of MST2, a protein kinase in the Hippo pathway.  The Hippo pathway has been implicated in control of liver morphology, inflammation and fibrosis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) govern thymic T lymphocyte differentiation and selection. Medullary TECs are distinctive for their "promiscuous" gene expression, transcribing thousands of peripheral tissue genes (PTG) that are otherwise only expressed highly in one or two other organs. Much of this PTG expression by mTECs is controlled by the autoimmune regulator, AIRE. This experiment was part of a larger study in which we examined the impact of Kat7 loss on AIRE-mediated PTG expression. more...

The previous Poldip2 knockout mouse generated by the gene trap model suffers from two limitations: perinatal lethality in homozygotes and constitutive Poldip2 inactivation. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new conditional floxed Poldip2 mouse. Here, we correctly targeted floxed Poldip2 mice to produce a new constitutive knockout line by crossing with a Cre deleter. more...

Because so many chromatin factors regulate gene expression, we used ATAC-seq to report the status of a given locus at any time—the sum total of all epigenetic modifiers—in a mouse model of pressure overload hypertrophy. Early compensation of pressure overload at 3 days was associated with widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation, the majority of which persisted to the decompensated phase (3 weeks), revealing the temporal nature of epigenomic compensation to pathologic stimuli. more...

(Submitter supplied) In mouse early organogenic stages, a Mab21l1-null mutation causes severe defects in invagination of the lens placode toward optic cup due to its severe defects in both cell proliferation and survival, which subsequently results in severe microphthalmia after birth. In human, loss of function variants in MAB21L1 have recently been described in Cerebello-Oculo-Facio-Genital syndrome (COFG syndrome). The close similarity between mouse and human phenotypes including microphthalmia indicates the importance of Mab21l1 function in human lens placode. more...

174. Transcriptome analysis of memantine-treated Shank2 wild-type and knock-out mice
(Submitter supplied) Shank2 is an excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein strongly implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Shank2-mutant mice with a homozygous deletion of exons 6 and 7 show decreased NMDA receptor (NMDAR) functions and autistic-like behaviors in juvenile (~postnatal day or P21) and adult (> P56) stages that are rescued by NMDAR activation. These mice, however, show an opposite change increased NMDAR functions—at ~P14, and NMDAR suppression by early and chronic memantine treatment during P7–21 prevents NMDAR hypofunction and autistic-like behaviors at juvenile (~P21) and adult (~P56) stages. more...

182. RNA-sequencing of mouse mammary tumor organoids that were modified to generate knockout lines for SOX4
(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor SOX4 is widely expressed during development and is essential to maintain progenitor pools in a variety of organs. In breast cancer SOX4 has been shown to be associated with poor survival and increased tumor size and metastasis formation. This has mostly been attributed to the ability of SOX4 to regulate Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT). However, SOX4 regulates target gene transcription in a plastic manner that is dependent on the cellular and epigenetic context. more...

207. An epithelial Nfkb2 pathway exacerbates intestinal inflammation by supplementing latent RelA complexes to the canonical NF-kB module
(Submitter supplied) The canonical NF-kB module induces nuclear translocation of RelA heterodimers from the latent cytoplasmic complexes. RelA directs inflammatory immune responses against microbial entities. However, aberrant RelA activity also triggers destructive inflammation, including those associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). What provokes this pathological RelA activity remains unclear. As such, the noncanonical NF-kB pathway activates RelB heterodimers and mediates immune organogenesis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived parvalbumin (PV)+, somatostatin (SST)+ and Neurogliaform (NGFC)-type cortical and hippocampal interneurons, have distinct molecular, anatomical and physiological properties. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating their diversity remain poorly understood. Here, via single-cell transcriptomics, we show that the obligate NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) subunit gene Grin1 mediates subtype-specific transcriptional regulation of gene expression in MGE-derived interneurons, leading to altered subtype identities. more...

(Submitter supplied) At 2 months of age, liver-specific insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mice present hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Furthermore, LIRKO mice have increased levels of hepatic cholesterol. Indeed, many changes seen in cholesterol metabolism in LIRKO mice are also observed in humans with metabolic syndrome. For example, both show decreased levels of HDL and increased secretion of apoB and VLDL. These findings make the LIRKO mouse a unique non-dietary model of insulin resistant, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis that resembles several clinical features of the human metabolic syndrome. more...

(Submitter supplied) RNG140 is an RNA-binding protein that increases in expression during eye lens differentiation and is involved in lens formation. However, the relevance of RNG140-mediated translational regulation to differentiation is not well understood. RNG140-mediated translational regulation operates in the mouse eye, where RNG140 knockout increased the translation of long mRNAs. mRNAs involved in lens differentiation, such as crystallin mRNAs, are short, and can escape translational inhibition by RNG140 and be translated in differentiating lenses.

FUS has been established to have a role in numerous aspects of RNA processing, including splicing. However, the impact of ALS-causative mutations on splicing has not been fully characterised, as most disease models have been based on FUS overexpression, which in itself alters its RNA processing functions. more...

(Submitter supplied) Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) relieves torsional stress in DNA during transcription and facilitates the expression of long (>100 kb) genes, many of which are important for neuronal functions. To evaluate how loss of Top1 affected neurons in vivo, we conditionally deleted (cKO) Top1 in postmitotic excitatory neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus. We found that Top1 cKO neurons developed properly but then showed biased transcriptional downregulation of long genes, signs of DNA damage, neuroinflammation, increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) activity, single-cell somatic mutations, and ultimately degenerated. more...

Genetically engineered mouse models have significantly enriched our understanding of plexiform forms of NFs (pNFs). However, this has not been the case for cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), observed in all NF1 patients, as no previous model recapitulates their development. Here, we show that conditional Nf1 inactivation in Prss56-positive boundary cap cells leads to bona fide pNFs and cNFs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Autophagy is implicated in promoting the metastatic potential of tumor cells. Utilizing a mouse model of mammary cancer to temporally delete essential autophagy regulators, ATG12 or ATG5, in tumor cells during distinct stages of carcinoma progression, we determine a stage-specific role for autophagy in suppressing metastatic colonization. In stark contrast to the tumor-promoting role of autophagy in primary mammary tumors, autophagy restricts colonization of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and prevents the acquisition of basal epithelial characteristics, effects that are dependent on turnover of the autophagy-specific substrate, Neighbor to BRCA1 (NBR1). more...

485. The Circadian Protein Nocturnin Regulates Metabolic Adaptation in Brown Adipose Tissue
(Submitter supplied) Fine-tuning of transcriptional responses can be critical for long-term outcomes in response to an environmental challenge. The circadian protein Nocturnin belongs to a family of proteins that include exonucleases, endonucleases and phosphatases and is most closely related to the CCR4 family of deadenylases that regulate the cellular transcriptome via control of polyA tail length of RNA transcripts. In this study, we investigate the role of Nocturnin in regulating the transcriptional response and downstream metabolic adaptations during cold exposure in brown adipose tissue. We find that Nocturnin exhibits dual localization within the cytosol and mitochondria, and loss of Nocturnin causes changes in expression of networks of mRNAs involved in mitochondrial function. Furthermore, Nocturnin-/- animals display significantly elevated levels of TCA cycle intermediates indicating that they have distinct metabolic adaptations during a prolonged cold exposure. We conclude that cold-induced stimulation of Nocturnin levels can regulate long-term metabolic adaptations to environmental challenges.

508. Single cell RNA-seq of Epidermal cells from newborn (P1) wildtype and BAP1 knockout mice
(Submitter supplied) BAP1 deletion in primary mouse epidermal cell culture leads to increased melanocytes population. However, it is unclear whether BAP1 exhibits its function in melanocytes or in the progenitor cells for melanocytes, since the epidermal culture contains a mixed cell types. We aim to carry out a single cell RNAseq profiling with this system, and dissect BAP1's roles in different cell types.

510. RNA-seq profiling of basal and luminal mammary cells from Foxp1-deficient and control mice
(Submitter supplied) Long-lived quiescent mammary stem cells (MaSCs) are presumed to coordinate the dramatic expansion of ductal epithelium that occurs through the different phases of postnatal development, but little is known about the molecular regulators that underpin the activation of MaSCs. Here we show that ablation of the transcription factor Foxp1 in the mammary gland profoundly impairs ductal morphogenesis, resulting in a rudimentary tree throughout adult life. more...

(Submitter supplied) Obesity-associated lipid overload triggers non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD), which in part may be driven by alterations of regulatory transcription networks and hepatocyte-selective epigenomes. Here we demonstrate that G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2), a subunit of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR)/ histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) complex, is a central component of such networks and accelerates the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). more...

516. FTO controls reversible m6Am RNA methylation during snRNA biogenesis
(Submitter supplied) Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are core spliceosome components and mediate pre-mRNA splicing. Here we show that snRNAs contain a regulated and reversible nucleotide modification causing them to exist as two different methyl isoforms, m 1 and m 2 , reflecting the methylation state of the adenosine adjacent to the snRNA cap. We find that snRNA biogenesis involves the formation of an initial m 1 isoform with a single-methylated adenosine (2′-O-methyladenosine, Am), which is then converted to a dimethylated m 2 isoform (N 6 ,2′-O-dimethyladenosine, m 6 Am). more...
